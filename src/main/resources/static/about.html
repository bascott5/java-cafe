    <p>Our business was founded by John Coffee in 1966, after he invented the first coffee. He shared it with friends and family, who told him he should start his own business. So he did! He called it a cafe, because he was too fancy to settle for calling his food service a restaurant. Since then, Java Coffee has locations all across America!</p>
